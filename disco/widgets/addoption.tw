args[0] = text for the option.
1 = whether it's a check or not.
2 = the passage that the option sends you to (for success if a check)
3 = passage for failure
4 = skillcheck difficulty number
5 = skillcheck stat
6 = skillcheck mod
7 = passage for success

i'm sorry this is obscene
ex: <<AddOption "here's a check" "true" "Succeed" "Fail" 10 $skill.int 1>>
=======
the first argument is the text for the option.
second is for the passage that the option sends you to.
third is whether it's a check or not.

ex: <<AddOption "here's a check" "CheckingPassage" "true">>
>>>>>>> parent of d645706... got skill roll working but not overlay
<<AddOption "here's a normal option" "passage">>
