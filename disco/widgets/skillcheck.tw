::SkillCheck [widget nobr]
/* rolls a skill check on 1d6.

ex: <<SkillCheck 10 stats.int 1>>

_difficultynum ($args[2]) is the difficulty you're trying to beat (if the difficulty is a 7, you want a 7 or higher)
_stat (3) is the stat you're using with a number associated with it.
_mods (4) is any stat number modifiers you might have due to previous actions, like drinking alcohol giving you a -1 or taking meds giving you a +1.
_roll is a random roll on 1d6, + _stat + _mods

<<<<<<< HEAD
if _passive is true:
        if the roll succeeds, set $success to true (interacts with PassiveSkill macro)
        if it fails, set it to false.

if _passive is false/not present:
        if _roll is more than or equal to the difficulty, show the success animation and forward to the success passage (0). if it's a fail, show the fail animation and forward to the fail passage (1).
